[](:!NAM) was a young [](:!AN) who lived just [](:!DIR) of [](:!PLA). it would always [](:!WE) on his property. but as soon as he left his property the [](:!WE) would stop. [](:!NAM) lived with a dog named [](:!DO) whos farts were so awful it would be beter if he just farted [](:!PO). One day the stareo started blasting [](:!SO) at [](:!VO), sudenly a [](:!DEOB) crashed through the wall with a plate of [](:!FOO)s sitting on top of it. [](:!DO) quickly ate every single [](:!FOO) before letting out the biggest fart he had ever farted. he farted so hard he was sent to  the [](:!NUM)th demention.
